# Hands-On Container Security: Attack Implementation & Mitigation
📌 Project Overview
This project explores container security vulnerabilities in Docker and Kubernetes, replicating real-world attacks and implementing security measures. The primary objectives are:

Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in container environments.
Understanding security risks associated with containerized applications.
Implementing security best practices to mitigate these threats.
The project demonstrates attacks such as runc escapes, privilege escalation, Kubernetes MITM attacks, and Docker image backdooring, while also covering security mechanisms like RBAC, AppArmor, cgroups, and runtime monitoring.

🛠 Setup & Environment
The project is conducted in a controlled Docker and Kubernetes environment to simulate attacks and security implementations. It involves:

A Docker environment running on a cloud-based infrastructure.
A Kubernetes cluster (Minikube) for testing Kubernetes-specific vulnerabilities.
Various security tools such as AppArmor, cgroups, and runtime monitoring utilities.
🚀 Vulnerability Demonstrations
1️⃣ runc Escape (CVE-2024-21626)
A critical vulnerability in runC, the container runtime for Docker and Kubernetes, allowing an attacker to escape container isolation and access the host system. This is achieved by manipulating file descriptors to trick the runtime into resolving paths outside the container environment.

2️⃣ Privilege Escalation via Docker Group
Granting users access to the Docker group inadvertently gives them root-level privileges on the host. Attackers can exploit this by mounting the host filesystem into a container and executing malicious commands with escalated privileges.

3️⃣ Kubernetes MITM Attack (CVE-2020-8554)
A vulnerability that allows an attacker to intercept network traffic within a Kubernetes cluster. By modifying the external IPs of a Kubernetes service, an attacker can redirect outbound traffic and monitor or manipulate communication between pods.

4️⃣ Backdooring Docker Images
A stealthy attack where an adversary injects a reverse shell or malware into a legitimate Docker image. When unsuspecting users deploy the compromised image, it provides the attacker unauthorized remote access to the container and potentially the host system.

🔒 Security Mitigation Strategies
✅ Patching & Best Practices
Regularly updating Docker, Kubernetes, and container runtimes to address known vulnerabilities.
Avoiding the use of privileged containers or running containers with excessive permissions.
✅ RBAC for Kubernetes Security
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to define granular permissions for different users and services within the Kubernetes cluster. This prevents unauthorized users from escalating privileges or accessing critical resources.

✅ AppArmor & cgroups for Container Hardening
AppArmor policies restrict what a containerized application can do, even if it has root privileges inside the container.
cgroups limit resource usage (CPU, memory, and processes) to prevent attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) from overwhelming the system.
✅ Runtime Security Monitoring
Deploying security monitoring tools to detect anomalies, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual process behavior inside containers.
Implementing log monitoring for Kubernetes and Docker to track potential security incidents in real time.
📖 Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding container security threats and their mitigation techniques. By replicating real-world attacks, we highlight the importance of proactive security measures such as patching vulnerabilities, enforcing least privilege access, and using security policies like AppArmor and RBAC.

🔹 Key Takeaways:

Always keep container runtimes updated to mitigate known CVEs.
Implement RBAC and AppArmor to restrict access and reduce attack surfaces.
Monitor runtime activity to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
